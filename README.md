A simple REST user service written in Scala that demonstrates [spray](http://spray.io) and [Slick 3](http://slick.typesafe.com/).

It is based on [spray-template](https://github.com/spray/spray-template) and also inspired by [s4](https://github.com/jacobus/s4/).

In order to test it just type `./run.sh` and then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in a web browser.

If you are facing any problems make sure that you have [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed properly.

In addition, a simple unit test based on [specs2](https://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) is provided. 

It is a level two REST service according to [Richardson Maturity Model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html).
